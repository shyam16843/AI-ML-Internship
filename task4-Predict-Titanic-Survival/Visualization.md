# Titanic Survival Prediction - Visualizations

This document provides detailed descriptions and insights into all visualizations generated during the Titanic survival analysis project.

## 1. Feature Importance - Logistic Regression

**Description:**  
A horizontal bar plot showing the top 10 features influencing the logistic regression model based on absolute coefficient values. The most influential features are at the top, with larger bars indicating greater importance.

**Insights:**  
- **Sex** (Female) significantly increases survival probability.
- **Title_Master** (Children) is a strong positive indicator.
- **Pclass** (Passenger class) is key: higher classes correlate with higher survival.
- Features like **FamilySize**, **Title_Mrs**, and age groupings also contribute, revealing underlying social and demographic patterns.

## 2. Feature Importance - Random Forest

**Description:**  
Bar chart depicting the top 10 features as identified by the Random Forest model’s feature importance scores.

**Insights:**  
- Variables like **Age**, **FarePerPerson**, and **Fare** are highly predictive, showing the importance of socioeconomic status.
- The significance of **Title** features again emphasizes social hierarchy.
- The model detects nonlinear relationships unnoticed by linear models, highlighting the value of ensemble methods.

## 3. Confusion Matrix - Logistic Regression

**Description:**  
A heatmap of the confusion matrix illustrating the classifier's predictions versus actual outcomes.

**Insights:**  
- Correctly classifies most "Did Not Survive" passengers, indicating high specificity.
- Some "Survived" passengers are misclassified, pointing to areas for model refinement.
- Visualizes class-wise prediction strengths and weaknesses.

## 4. ROC Curve - Logistic Regression

![ROC Curve - Logistic Regression](images/Figure_4.jpg)

**Description:**  
ROC curve depicting the true positive rate versus false positive rate across different thresholds for the logistic regression model, with the AUC score annotated.

**Insights:**  
- A high AUC (~0.88) shows excellent discriminating ability.
- The curve's shape confirms the model effectively separates survivors from non-survivors.

## 5. Confusion Matrix - Random Forest

![Confusion Matrix - Random Forest](images/Figure_5.jpg)

**Description:**  
Heatmap of the Random Forest model's confusion matrix.

**Insights:**  
- Slightly more false negatives compared to Logistic Regression.
- The matrix indicates good but improvable classification performance.

---

## 6. ROC Curve - Random Forest

![ROC Curve - Random Forest](images/Figure_6.jpg)

**Description:**  
ROC curve illustrating model performance with an AUC of approximately 0.83.

**Insights:**  
- The model performs well but slightly underperforms Logistic Regression.
- Confirms the ensemble captures complex nonlinear patterns.

## 7. Final Prediction Examples

| Description | Prediction | Probability | Confidence |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| First-class female adult | Survived | 95.42% | High |
| Third-class male child | Did Not Survive | 28.15% | High |

**Insights:**  
- Predictions align with known trends—women and children more likely to survive.
- Probabilities reinforce model confidence levels.

## Summary of Visualizations

These plots collectively confirm the importance of features like **Sex**, **Title**, **Pclass**, and **Fare**. They reveal the model's strong discriminative power and pinpoint areas like misclassification patterns for further improvement. Visuals like ROC and confusion matrices are critical for validating model robustness.

*Note:* All images are stored in the `/images/` directory.
