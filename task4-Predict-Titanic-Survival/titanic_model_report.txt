TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION PROJECT REPORT
==================================================
Generated on: 2025-09-16 21:28:45

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Dataset: Titanic passenger data (n=358)
- Target variable: Survival (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
- Best model: LogisticRegression
- Final test accuracy: 0.8492

DATA PREPROCESSING:
- Handled missing values in Age and Embarked
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Created new features: FamilySize, IsAlone, AgeGroup, FarePerPerson, Title
- Scaled numerical features: Age, Fare, FarePerPerson, SibSp, Parch, FamilySize

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Accuracy: 0.8492
- Precision: 0.8387
- Recall: 0.7536
- F1-Score: 0.7939
- ROC AUC: 0.8794

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Most important predictive factors:
         Feature  Importance
1            Sex    2.395521
17  Title_Master    2.227961
0         Pclass    1.041522
20     Title_Mrs    0.605016
9     FamilySize    0.506134

2. Model confidence:
- High confidence predictions: 42/179
- Low confidence predictions: 100/179
- Uncertain predictions: 37/179

3. Demographic patterns confirmed:
- Women had significantly higher survival rates
- Children were prioritized for rescue
- Higher-class passengers had better survival chances

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The model can predict survival with 84.9% accuracy
2. Most reliable for female passengers and children
3. Use for historical analysis and educational purposes

MODEL LIMITATIONS:
- Based on historical data from 1912
- Limited by available passenger information
- Some demographic groups have small sample sizes
